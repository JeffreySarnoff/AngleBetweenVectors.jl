### An accurate and stable calculation of the angle separating two vectors.

- The shorter of two complemetary angle solutions as an unoriented magnitude (always >= zero).

- Vectors are given by their Cartesian coordinates in 2D, 3D or .. N-dimensions.
- Vectors may be given as Tuples or as Array{T,1}s of length N.
